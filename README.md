# 3-JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Homework 3 Introduction
Utilizing Javascript, we were tasked with creating a random password generator. Users would input a series of criteria – desired password length, inclusion of various alphanumeric character types, etc. – and the website would output a random password meeting those criteria.

### Javascript
#### The initial javascript file, as provided by the class, was sparse:
- In the HTML, a button had been created
- Upon clicking the button, the "writePassword" function would run
- Within the "writePassword" function, the following steps would occur:
    - The "generatePassword" function would run, outputting the variable "password"
    - Using a query selector, the HTML document's textarea (which had an id = "password" and placeholder text of "Your Secure Password") would get assigned to the variable "passwordText"
    - Then, the variable "passwordText" would receive the value contained in the variable "password"
    - The value of the variable "passwordText" (aka, the generated password from the function "generatePassword") gets printed back on the HTML document in the textarea
#### Our task was to create the generatePassword function
